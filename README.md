Raspberry Pi & LED-Strip
====================

[Here](http://dordnung.de/raspberrypi-ledstrip/) you can find a tutorial about how to connect a Raspberry Pi to a LED-Strip

This is code based off of and using the tutorial above.
I am just trying to set up simple LED controls using a wireless USB keyboard connected to a rasperry Pi 3 running raspian.

Eventually I want to use [Blynk](https://www.blynk.cc/) to control the LED over the internet.
